Q: At a presentation about post traumatic stress disorder, would Ariana Grande be a topic of relevance?
A: Let’s think step by step.
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is caused by events involving violence, harm, or torture.
Ariana Grande is an artist.
She was performing in Manchester in 2017 when explosives were set off in an act of terrorism.
Setting off explosives is an act of violence intended to cause harm to people.
Ariana Grande has spoken openly about her trauma experience and her PTSD regarding the Manchester Bombing.
A presentation on PTSD would involve people who have experienced trauma at some point in their lives.
Thus, Ariana Grande would be relevant at a discussion on PTSD.
So the answer is yes.

Q: Is Benjamin Franklin a prime candidate to have his statues removed by Black Lives Matter movement?
A: Let’s think step by step.
Benjamin Franklin, a famous founding father, has his image on many monuments and on American currency.
Benjamin Franklin's 1730s newspaper, The Philadelphia Gazette, posted ads for black slaves.
Benjamin Franklin owned two slaves, George and King, who worked as personal servants.
Thus Benjamin Franklin did not view black people as equals to people of other races.
The Black Lives Matter movement is a social movement advocating for racial equality.
Members of the Black Lives Matter movement petitioned for statues of Christopher Columbus to be removed due to his subjugation of Native Americans.
Thus the Black Lives Matter will likely want Benjamin Franklin's statues removed.
So the answer is yes.

Q: Are Doctors of Homeopathy more likely than Doctors of Internal Medicine to recommend Quartz as a treatment?
A: Let’s think step by step.
Doctors of Homeopathy are practitioners of alternative medicine.
In alternative medicine practices, Quartz is believed to have healing powers.
Internal Medicine focuses on treatment with medication based on scientific knowledge.
All relevant scientific knowledge contradicts homeopathy or alternative medicine.
Doctors of Internal Medicine do not recommend alternative medicine.
Doctors of Internal Medicine do not believe Quartz can be used for treatment.
Homeopathy practitioners will on the other hand recommend Quartz.
So the answer is yes.

Q: Could Bernie Sanders visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art twenty times for under two hundred dollars?
A: Let’s think step by step.
Bernie Sanders is a senior citizen.
At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, senior citizens from outside NY, NJ, or CT must pay $17 per visit.
Twenty visits would cost $17 times twenty, which is more than two hundred dollars.
So under two hundred dollars, less than twenty visits are possible.
Thus Bernie Sanders cannot visit the museum twenty times under two hundred dollars.
So the answer is no.

Q: Would Eric Clapton's mother hypothetically be unable to legally purchase cigarettes in the USA at his birth?
A: Let’s think step by step.
Eric Clapton is a musician.
At the time of his birth, his mother was 16 years old.
As of 2020, federal law in the USA required states comply with a minimum age of 21 years for sale/purchase of tobacco products.
At the time of his birth, Eric Clapton's mother was too young to legally purchase tobacco products.
Cigarettes are tobacco products.
So hypothetically, Eric Clapton's mother did not meet the minimum age requirement to legally purchase cigarettes.
So the answer is yes.

Q: Can an adult male stand on top Donatello's bronze David and touch the Sistine Chapel ceiling?
A: Let’s think step by step.
The average height of an adult male is around six feet.
The tallest adult male in history was eight feet and eleven inches.
Donatello's created a bronze David statue that stands over five feet tall.
If the tallest adult male stood on top of the bronze David, he would reach a height of eight plus five feet approximately.
Eight plus five feet is thirteen feet.
The Sistine Chapel ceiling is sixty eight feet high, which is much taller than thirteen feet.
Thus the adult male standing on top of Donatello's bronze David would not reach the Sistine Chapel ceiling.
So the answer is no.
